# 📘 Cluster Tool Usage Report  
### *Coating Competence Center – Usage Summary*  
**Period Analyzed:** January 1, 2024 – January 15, 2025   
---

## 🧭 Summary & context

The **Cluster Tool (CT)** at the Coating Competence Center of EMPA is a cornerstone for agile thin-film deposition and experimentation. It is a cluster of three deposition chambers (Chamber 2, 4 and 6), each with different material targets installed, which users can use for sputtering, for a plethora of
applications, including both internal and external projects in various industries.

With over **3,000 hours** of logged operations and **462 individual processes**, CT supports intensive internal and collaborative R&D, remaining highly reliable with minimal downtime.

## 📅 3. When and How Is CT Used?

### 📆 Advance Booking Behavior

![Advance Booking](Images/z_How_early_booked_days.tif)

- **Most bookings are made 1 day in advance**, indicating fast-paced experimental workflows.
- Negative values represent bookings done retroactively, after the starting time has passed, likely for spontaneous processes.

### ☀️ Time-of-Day Preferences

![Time of Day](Images/Tudor_CT_usage_daytime.png)

- **Afternoon and overnight runs are most common**.
- Runs are **clustered near End-of-Day (EOD)**.
- **Chamber 4** often used for longer processes extending overnight.

![User Needs](Images/Tudor_CT_usage_user_needs.png)

Information compiles from all messages, requests, questions etc. across all communication channels, into a word cloud, in order to identify
the main user needs.

Users have questions about:
1. **Availability** – Access to infrastructure, availability in schedule
2. **Knowledge** – Access to information
3. **Ability** – Availability of immediate help
4. **Urgency** – Is there a compelling driver (e.g. deadlines)?
	- The vast majority of maintenances/interventions happen within a day of the issue being reported.
